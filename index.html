        <h2 class="mb-5">Inland Valley Hospice/ Volunteer
June 2021 - February 2022,  Riverside, CA
Provided extra comfort and support to patients and family members by being present and relieving some responsibilities off of the caretaker. Also provided assistance in an administrative setting by filing, organizing, and creating packets. 
UCR SOM Pipeline Program Future Physician Leaders/ Researcher (group leader)
June 2021 - March 2022,  Riverside, CA
Created a community health project specifically targeting health issues present in the Inland Empire. Our project Code Red spread awareness about period poverty. Period poverty is the lack of access to menstrual products due to socioeconomic factors. Many people were unaware of the topic so as a group we outreached and presented to many groups such as the Coachella Valley Volunteers in Medicine, San Bernardino Unified School District, Inland Congregations United for Change, and many more. At the end of the program our group was chosen to present at the UCR School of Medicine Quality Improvement Conference. 
Alpha Chi Omega / Philanthropy
January  2020 - Present,  Riverside
Partnered up with a fraternity, and participated in a  number of events to help raise $15,947 for Childrenâ€™s Miracle Network.
